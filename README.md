# Prototype of an automatic irrigation system
## About the project
I've made this project for my bachelor's degree thesis. It is a small scale rendition of an automated irrigation system, with a frontend for monitoring the moisure values (in real time*)[find out how to link text] and set the irrigation rules.

This fork contains a simple demo that is not actually connected to any real hardware system. The actual project, that does need hardware components to work, can be found (here)[link]

You can visit the demo live (here)[link].
Otherwise, if you want to self host it, you can do it with this (instruction)[link]

\* It's not actually real time, but it is gatering data every 500ms
